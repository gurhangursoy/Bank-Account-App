## General info

### How can I login to the account ?

There are 4 different accounts in the application. User and PIN information are as in the table below. 
User information was obtained by taking the first letters of the account holder's name and surname. 
The information is chosen this way for ease of use.

User | PIN
---- | ----
aa | 1111
bb | 2222
cc | 3333
dd | 4444

### How do I transfer money to another account ?

You can send money by determining the account you want to send money to and the amount you want to send from the Transfer money tab.

### How do I close my account ?

You can close your account by entering your account information in the close account section.

### How can I use the request loan section ?

The system will allow you to withdraw up to 10 times the highest amount you have ever deposited into your account. 
Of course, I have to admit that there is a bug at this point :).
